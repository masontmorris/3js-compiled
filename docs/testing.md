# Scripted host tests

The host reads a JSON array with `--script <path>`. It processes steps in order before a frame. `wait` renders the given number of frames before the next step. `capture` saves the next rendered frame and then continues with the following step. `close` exits with code 0.

```json
[
  {"type":"wait","frames":2},
  {"type":"key","code":"KeyW","down":true},
  {"type":"capture","path":"out/key.png"},
  {"type":"key","code":"KeyW","down":false},
  {"type":"pointer","action":"move","x":100,"y":100},
  {"type":"pointer","action":"down","x":100,"y":100,"button":0},
  {"type":"pointer","action":"up","x":100,"y":100,"button":0},
  {"type":"wheel","x":0,"y":1},
  {"type":"gamepad","index":0,"button":0,"down":true},
  {"type":"resize","width":1280,"height":720},
  {"type":"capture","path":"out/input.png"},
  {"type":"close"}
]
```

The host sends key, pointer, wheel, gamepad, and resize events to `addEventListener` on the global object. `innerWidth` and `innerHeight` hold the window size in pixels and change before each resize event. `self` and `window` refer to the global object, and `TextDecoder` decodes UTF-8. Real and scripted key events use DOM `code` values and the same event fields. Printable `key` values use a US keyboard layout; real keys account for Shift and Caps Lock. Scripted keys use the unmodified values. Real wheel deltas use DOM directions, with positive X to the right and positive Y down. Gamepad button 0 is A. `navigator.getGamepads()` exposes the injected button state. `setClearColor(r, g, b, a)` sets the next frame's color with normalized values. `requestAnimationFrame`, `cancelAnimationFrame`, `performance.now()`, and `console` are available to entry modules. A frame callback error is logged and does not stop later callbacks. After each frame callback batch and event dispatch, the host runs promise jobs and polls ready asynchronous operations without waiting for pending operations.

`--record <directory>` saves every rendered frame as a PNG, starting at `000000.png`. The directory must be empty. `--vsync on` is the default. Use `--vsync off` or its alias `--novsync` for uncapped runs. The host writes `host.log` and `frames.csv` in the working directory. The CSV contains the zero-based frame number, CPU-side frame duration in milliseconds, and frame-start interval in milliseconds. CPU-side duration uses a monotonic clock from the start of the frame through submission and any capture, before presentation. It excludes the wait to acquire a surface frame. It includes scheduling delays and waits during the remaining operations.

## GPU lease

On the shared Windows machine, wrap every host run with the GPU lease. Do not hold a lease while waiting for review.

```powershell
python C:\Users\mason\.gpu\gpu_lease.py run --holder 3jsc-e1 --purpose "scripted host test" -- C:\3jsc\target\debug\host.exe --entry examples/input.js --script path/to/steps.json
```

## GPU command responses

An entry module can call `submitGpuCommands(bytes)` once between host frames. The host copies the `Uint8Array`, replays it against that frame's surface texture, and dispatches a `gpu-response` event when responses are available. The event's `responses` array contains readback objects with `request` and `bytes`, or error objects with a command index, optional request, and message. The host also writes errors to `host.log`. A second submission before the host consumes the first throws an error. The host clears the frame to the `setClearColor` color only when the frame's commands did not acquire the surface.
